# makeItHappen

Make it happen is an app to record your daily problems. When the app is running in background, it will keep tracking your activity and will record what it think is a problem, and collect them for your personal analysis. Every sentence you've typed ending with '?' will be recorded as a problem, and every sentence end with '!' will be recorded as a todo. You don't need to open a special app to manage them, such as page, Evernote, and Pomotodo. We are keep developing applications on other platforms as well.

The problems will be collected to our website. http://18.218.219.51:8081/toLogin, all of them are only visible to yourself unless you choose to publicize them.

The applications and websites are still in testing.
